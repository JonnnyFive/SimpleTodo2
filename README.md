## Notes

Most of the project videos were for mac and were a bit dated. I ran into a few issues because of this that kept my pace slow. I worked on the project about 2 hours each night for a total of 4 nights. In the end it was an excellent exersise in using the Android project enviornment. After complpetion I felt the most overwhelmed during the early set up, implementation process, and keeping pace with the material coverd.
